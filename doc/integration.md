#Integration Guide

##Including the SDK in your project
This guide assumes you use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) to manage your project dependencies. If you do not, refer to our [official documentation](http://this_should_be_some_valid_link) for an alternative setup approach.

Open up your Podfile and add the following line:

    pod "InApp"

Then simply run `pod install` in your project directory and you will be good to go.
